# linkss

This is a URL shortner web app, written in Javascript.
It runs in Node.js, uses Microsoft SQL as the database, and uses Express for routing.

The web app at [linkss.tk](https://linkss.tk) is deployed on Microsoft Azure, as is the SQL Database.

[linkss.tk](https://linkss.tk) is a free domain name I obtained from [freenom](http://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en).
It defaults to https thanks to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)'s free https certs/routing.

Contributions are always welcome. Thank you for checking it out :)
